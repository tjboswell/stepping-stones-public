"Stepping Stones" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022

Stepping Stones explores the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.
